        <p>Back in 2021, I decided that I wanted to pursue my passion for computers so I applied to a tech school called Vinal Technical High School. Little did I know, it would be the best 4 years here. What I learned while still here was so much more than I could ever imagine. I took the trade of Information Technology or for short I.T. and started learning the fundamentals of computers, but also during that time, my teacher introduced me to web development, and that's where my journey began down a rabbit hole of coding. Fast-forward to my Senior year where I currently am, I mainly focus on getting certificates to improve my resume, and also working on many projects involving a variety of programming languages from front-end to back-end. During this time I've had the great opportunity to work at my current company Jarvis Products Corporation.</p>

        <p>My main focus these days is to learn and pick up as many skills as I can so I can improve on what I already have now while also preparing for college. I plan on going to CCSU and majoring in Computer Science and hopefully landing a position as a Software Engineer after graduation.</p>

        <p>Outside of my coding life, I like to create and design images. During my free time, I use Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator to design and create my images. I also love listening to music and am always frequently exploring many genres and hopefully, one day producing my own music for the world. On the side, I take part in community service at my local church and love helping the younger ones and guiding them as they grow up.</p>
