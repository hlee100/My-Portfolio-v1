        <p>In the 8th grade, I decided to take a risk and pursue my dream of computers. I applied to Vinal Technical High School. Little did I know, it would be the best risk I'd ever taken in a while. What I learned while still here was so much more than I could ever imagine. I took the Information Technology trade and started learning the fundamentals of computers, but also during that time, my teacher introduced me to Web-Development, and that's where my journey began. Fast-forward to the 11th grade where I currently am, I am focusing on getting certificates to improve my resume, and also working on other websites to improve my skills. While also having the opportunity to help out actual clients in designing and building their websites.</p>

        <p>My main focus these days is to learn and pick up as much as I can and to improve on what I already have right now. I plan on going to college and obtaining my degree in Computer Science and hopefully landing a position as a Front-End Software Engineer.</p>

        <p>Outside of my programming life, I like to create and design imagery in my free time I use Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator to make my images. I also love listening to music and always frequently exploring many genres and hopefully, one day publish my own music to the world. On the side, I take part in community service at my local church and love helping the younger ones and guiding them as they grow up.</p>
